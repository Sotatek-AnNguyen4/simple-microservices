# simple-microservices
This is a simple microservices that was built during a learning phase

The following stacks were used:
1. Spring Boot Microservices
2. Multi-database storage: MongoDB for one set of data and PostgresDB for another
3. Service discovery: Spring Cloud Consul
4. Fault tolerance: Resilience4j
5. Security: Spring Security

The source code includes an embedded docker-compose file for running and testing the application locally
